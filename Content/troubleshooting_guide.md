 Identify Common Issues
○ If you encounter a “401 Unauthorized” error:
■ Check Authentication: Verify the AUTH_TOKEN or access token. Ensure
it’s active and has the necessary permissions.
■ Environment Variables: Make sure the environment variables in
Postman are correctly set.
■ Rate Limits: Some APIs restrict the number of requests within a given
timeframe. Document handling of these limits in Colab or Postman using
error handling.
